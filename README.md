# Retail Data Integration and Insights Dashboard

Objective:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The objective of this project is to analyze retail data by loading multiple tables, defining and managing relationships between them, and creating insights and a high-level dashboard. The project aims to provide various analysis reports and metrics to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and other key aspects of the retail business.

Business Problem:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The retail business requires comprehensive insights into sales, revenue, customer behavior, and trends. By analyzing the retail data, the project aims to address business problems such as identifying top-selling products, understanding customer preferences, evaluating revenue performance, and gaining actionable insights for decision-making.

Data Availability:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project utilizes retail data stored in four disparate files. These files contain information about sales transactions, pin codes, city tiers, and geographic details. The data is used to establish relationships and perform analysis to derive meaningful insights.

Historical Data:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project uses historical retail data to understand past trends and performance. The availability of historical data allows for trend analysis, identification of seasonality patterns, and evaluation of long-term business performance.

Tools Used:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project utilizes tools such as Microsoft Excel or a dedicated data analysis software that supports data modeling and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas. The data modeling capability is used to load and manage multiple tables, define relationships, and create a data model for analysis. DAX formulas are employed to enhance the dataset and create calculated fields.

My Role:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the data analyst or project participant, my role is to perform data loading, preprocessing, data modeling, relationship definition, and analysis using DAX formulas. I am responsible for creating the necessary fields, generating insights, and designing the high-level dashboard.

Steps Performed:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading all four files into the data model, ensuring proper field names in the headers.

Dropping records with missing values in specific columns of the 'PinCode-Geo' and 'Mod3_Raw_CityTier_v0 1' tables.

Establishing relationships between the tables, especially connecting the 'City' field in the 'Mod3_Raw_CityTier_v0 1' table with the 'City' field in the 'PinCodeGeo' table.

Creating a new column, 'Net_Units,' using DAX formulas to calculate the difference between 'Units' and 'Cancelled_Units' in the sales table.

Renaming the 'City' column to 'City_Old' and creating a new 'City' column with only the city name, removing the country part, from the 'Mod3_Raw_CityTier_v0 1' and 'PinCode-Geo' files.

Creating a field called 'OrderDayOfWeek' to capture the day of the week for each sale.

Using DAX formulas, creating a field called 'OrderWeekStart' to determine the start date of the sales week, with weeks starting from Monday. Formatting the field to display dates like 'Nov 06' for November 6th.

Updating the relationships between the tables to ensure proper connections.

Creating various analysis reports, such as total revenue, total quantity, cancellations, number of customers, number of transactions, by month, week, weekday, product group, city, zone, city tier, etc.

Creating a dashboard that includes the above analysis reports, providing a high-level overview of retail performance.

Techniques:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project involves techniques such as data modeling, relationship management, data preprocessing, DAX formula creation, trend analysis, and dashboard design. These techniques are utilized to extract insights and generate meaningful reports.

Metrics:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Metrics used in the analysis may include total revenue, total quantity, cancellations, number of customers, number of transactions, and various aggregated metrics based on different dimensions such as month, week, weekday, product group, city, zone, and city tier.

Validation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Validation is performed by cross-checking the results with expectations, verifying data accuracy, and ensuring the relationships and calculations produce meaningful insights. Validation may involve comparing results against historical trends, business knowledge, or external benchmarks.

Challenges:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Challenges in this project may include handling missing data, establishing accurate relationships between tables, dealing with data inconsistencies, managing large datasets, ensuring data accuracy during preprocessing, and designing an intuitive and informative dashboard. Additionally, interpreting the insights and communicating them effectively to stakeholders can also be a challenge.
